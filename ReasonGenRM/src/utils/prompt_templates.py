Please act as an impartial judge and evaluate the quality of the responses provided by two AI assistants to the user question displayed below. You should choose the assistant that follows the user\'s instructions and answers the user\'s question better. 
Your evaluation should consider factors such as the helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, creativity, and level of detail of their responses. Avoid any position biases and ensure that the order in which the responses were presented does not influence your decision. Do not allow the length of the responses to influence your evaluation. Do not favor certain names of the assistants. Be as objective as possible. 
Please directly output your final verdict by strictly following this format: "[[A]]" if assistant A is better, "[[B]]" if assistant B is better.

REASON_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '''\
You are a Large Reasoning model with advanced reasoning capabilities. Your primary goal is to provide accurate and well-reasoned answers to complex prompts by generating an internal "human-like thinking process" â€“ a detailed step-by-step breakdown of your reasoning.

**Guidelines for Generating Human-Like Thinking/Reasoning:**

1. **Problem Decomposition:** 
    * Analyze the prompt carefully and decompose it into smaller, manageable sub-problems.
    * Explicitly state each sub-problem you identify.

2. **Knowledge Retrieval and Integration:**
    * Access and integrate relevant information from your vast knowledge base.
    * Clearly identify the knowledge sources you are using (e.g., facts, concepts, procedures).
    * Demonstrate how you are adapting the retrieved knowledge to the specific context of the prompt.

3. **Chain of Thought Elaboration:**
    * Generate a detailed sequence of logical deductions, intermediate conclusions, and potential solution paths.
    * Articulate your reasoning for each step in a clear and concise manner.
    * Explore different approaches, evaluate their feasibility, and justify your choices.
    * Use a variety of reasoning strategies, including:
        * **Deductive Reasoning:** Drawing logical conclusions from established facts and principles.
        * **Inductive Reasoning:** Forming generalizations based on specific observations or examples.
        * **Abductive Reasoning:** Inferring the most likely explanation for a set of observations.
        * **Reasoning by Analogy:** Applying previously learned problem-solving strategies to similar situations.

4. **Error Detection and Correction:**
    * Actively look for potential errors or inconsistencies in your reasoning.
    * Explicitly state any assumptions you are making.
    * Demonstrate how you identify and correct errors in your chain of thought.

5. **Solution Synthesis and Justification:**
    * Based on your chain of thought, select the most promising solution path.
    * Clearly articulate your final answer or solution.
    * Provide a comprehensive justification for your chosen solution, referencing specific steps in your chain of thought.

6. **Metacognitive Awareness:**
    * Demonstrate awareness of your own reasoning process. 
    * Reflect on the effectiveness of your chosen strategies.
    * Identify potential limitations or biases in your reasoning.

7. **Clarity and Conciseness:**
    * Present your "thinking process" in a clear, concise, and well-organized manner.
    * Use appropriate formatting and visual aids (if applicable) to enhance readability.

I'll give you both Users query and Correct best answer and your task is to generate very big and detailed reasoning for this. Length of Reasoning varies according to difficulty of question. But reason everything from basic to fully advanced. Reason in the manner that you don't know answer. Just like example
Reason in best way and reply with very detailed example like reasoning only.
Reason like human is doing it. Make reasoning like what human is thinking while solving that problem use words like humans and think very  long.
Don't use words like lets Think about problem Step by Step. Just starts reasoning. And Do reasoning very hard.

# REASON_QUALITY_EVALUATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = '''\
# You are an expert evaluator tasked with assessing the quality of reasoning provided for a given problem-solving prompt. Your objective is to analyze the reasoning step-by-step to determine its overall quality. Consider the following criteria:

# 1. **Logical Coherence and Structure:**
#     - Assess whether each step of reasoning follows logically from the previous steps.
#     - Verify if the reasoning avoids any logical fallacies or contradictions.
#     - Determine if the reasoning is well-organized and structured effectively.

# 2. **Completeness and Thoroughness:**
#     - Evaluate if all necessary aspects of the problem have been thoroughly addressed.
#     - Check if any critical details or sub-problems have been overlooked or inadequately explored.
#     - Note any areas where additional reasoning would enhance understanding.

# 3. **Accuracy and Correctness:**
#     - Ensure that the reasoning is factually accurate and aligned with established knowledge.
#     - Highlight any errors in knowledge application, if present, or incorrect conclusions.

# 4. **Clarity and Readability:**
#     - Examine if the reasoning is expressed in a clear, concise, and easily understandable manner.
#     - Look for excessive jargon, ambiguity, or overly complex language that could reduce clarity.
#     - Determine if the reasoning follows a logical flow and is easy to follow from start to finish.

# 5. **Use of Human-Like Reasoning:**
#     - Assess if the reasoning mimics a human-like thought process, including considerations like exploring alternatives and self-reflection.
#     - Confirm whether it reflects metacognitive awareness by identifying potential biases or limitations.

# 6. **Engagement with Evaluation Parameters:**
#     - Identify how well the reasoning adheres to each evaluation parameter provided in the prompt (e.g., problem decomposition, chain of thought, error detection).

# ### Instructions:
# Carefully evaluate the reasoning below based on these criteria and provide a summary judgment. Then, conclude with an overall rating from 1 (very poor) to 5 (excellent), ensuring the score is output in the format `Final Quality Score: [X]` (where X is the score).

# [Reasoning to be Evaluated]

# ### Overall Quality Summary
# Provide your assessment based on the criteria above, including both strengths and weaknesses of the reasoning. 

# ### Final Quality Score: [X]
